  # Credo is optional on purpose: `PureFun.Check.Purity` is only compiled
  # when the project using this library has Credo of its own, so a
  # build-time analysis tool everyone is expected to add to their project
  # still drags nothing in.

  # It must not say `only:`. The host project ignores the `only:`
  # dependencies of a dependency, so Credo would then not be built before
  # this library, and the check would be compiled or not by luck.
